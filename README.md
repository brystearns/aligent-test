## Aligent Restaurant Test
This is the Aligent test task sent out, as per the guidelines below.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##The Challenge

Your task is to use the Zomato API (api request information and documentation resides here https://developers.zomato.com/api) to build a restaurant navigator and viewer. We would like you to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to read the API and display it in an organized way.


We’ve provided you some design assets for you to use for this task (see https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J1IJzSQ7D6EdL9Xh3YAVnoEFxbp9nkhE/view?usp=sharing) While we’re not looking a pixel-perfect rendering of this design into code, we would like to see your solution be inspired by this wireframe example.


Functionally, the user selects a number of attributes in the top section of this display, which then filters the list of restaurants that are listed on the left-hand column. On selecting an entry, the full details for the restaurant is displayed in the main (RHS) section of this display.


Feel free to ask any questions regarding the requirements. We look forward to seeing your solution.
